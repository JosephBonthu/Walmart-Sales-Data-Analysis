# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis

Project Description:
In this project, we will analyse a large Walmart sales dataset to extract useful insights, discover sales patterns, and understand consumer behaviour across several Walmart outlets. This research, which uses a comprehensive dataset from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, covers historical sales data and includes indicators such as sales volume, consumer demographics, product lines, and more.
The major purpose of this project is to understand the complexities of Walmart's sales dynamics, including highlighting top-performing branches and items, identifying consumer purchasing patterns, and assessing the effectiveness of sales methods. This project bridges the gap between raw data and practical business insights by combining powerful SQL techniques for data processing with Tableau for colourful, interactive visuals.

Tools and Technologies:
SQL: Served as the backbone for data querying, cleaning, and transformation, enabling a structured analysis of complex datasets.

Tableau: Utilized for data visualization capabilities, transforming intricate data sets into comprehensible, interactive dashboards that facilitate deeper insights and storytelling.
